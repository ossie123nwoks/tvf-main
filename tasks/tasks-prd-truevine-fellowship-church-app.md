### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- This is a new project, so all infrastructure needs to be set up from scratch.
- The tech stack includes React Native with TypeScript, Expo + Expo Router, React Native Paper, and Supabase.
- Push notifications and offline downloads are included in the initial release as per PRD requirements.
- Dark mode is included in the initial release as per PRD requirements.
- Consider implementing features incrementally, starting with core functionality before adding advanced features.
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states throughout the app for better user experience.
- Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android devices to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
- When implementing dark mode, ensure all components and screens properly support both themes with appropriate color schemes.
- Test dark mode functionality in various lighting conditions to ensure readability and accessibility.
- **Authentication is mandatory** - all users must sign up before accessing any app content.
- **No guest access** - implement proper authentication guards on all routes and content.
- **Onboarding required** - new users should complete a brief onboarding process after signup.
