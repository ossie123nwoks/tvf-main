## 1. Introduction/Overview

The TRUEVINE FELLOWSHIP Church App is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between physical church services and digital engagement. The app addresses the challenge of church members and visitors needing easy access to spiritual content, sermon recordings, and church information outside of regular service times.

**Problem Statement:** Church members and visitors currently struggle to access sermons, articles, and church updates when they're not physically present at the church. This creates a disconnect between weekly services and daily spiritual growth.

**Solution:** A mobile app that provides 24/7 access to church content, enabling users to listen to sermons, read articles, and stay connected with the church community from anywhere.

**Goal:** Create an engaging, user-friendly mobile experience that strengthens the spiritual connection between TRUEVINE FELLOWSHIP and its congregation while making church content accessible to a wider audience.
